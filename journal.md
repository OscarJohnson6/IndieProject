<h2>Indie Fitness App Project</h2>

<small>A weekly journal going over the changes and activities done while 
creating and researching the Fitness app.</small>

<h3>Journal 1, 1/21-28/2024</h3>

I started getting the files and folders set up for the project. 
As well as thinking about what to have the project be about and all do.

<h3>Journal 2, 1/29/2024 - 2/4/2024</h3>

I have a pretty decent idea of what I plan to make as well as some APIs I might use. 
I added a sketch of quick wireframe I made for the website. 
Two APIs I was thinking about using are <a href="">FitCalculator</a> & <a href="">FitCalculator</a> 
from <a href="">FitCalculator</a> for calculating the health totals as well as creating the exercises.
