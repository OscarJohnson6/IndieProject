I started getting the files and folders set up for the project. 
As well as thinking about what to have the project be about and all do.

I have a pretty decent idea of what I plan to make as well as some APIs I might use. 
I added a sketch of quick wireframe I made for the website. 
Three APIs I was thinking about using are 
                     <a href="https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/">ExerciseDB</a> 
& <a href="https://rapidapi.com/malaaddincelik/api/fitness-calculator/">Fitness Calculator</a>
& <a href="https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/exercises-by-api-ninjas/">Exercises API-Ninjas</a>
from <a href="https://rapidapi.com/search/fitness">RapidAPI</a> for calculating the health totals as well as creating the exercises.

<h3>Journal 3, 2/5-12/2024</h3>

Looked into which http client to use for connecting to APIs. Decided to go with OkHttpClient after reading a stack overflow
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42392778/okhttp-or-httpclient-which-offers-better-functionality-and-more-efficiency">post</a>
& <a href="https://www.wiremock.io/post/java-http-client-comparison">article</a>
by WireMock. 
While creating my jsp pages I looked at this <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/">site</a> to help set up my footer css.
Overall for this week I created the basic display JSPs and layouts for other files to be easily added as well as all the dependencies to the pom.xml.
