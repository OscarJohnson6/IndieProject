I started getting the files and folders set up for the project.
As well as thinking about what to have the project be about and all do.

### Journal 2, 1/29/2024 - 2/4/2024
I have a pretty decent idea of what I plan to make as well as some APIs I might use.
I added a sketch of quick wireframe I made for the website.
Three APIs I was thinking about using are
[ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/)
& [Fitness Calculator](https://rapidapi.com/malaaddincelik/api/fitness-calculator/)
& [Exercises API-Ninjas](https://rapidapi.com/apininjas/api/exercises-by-api-ninjas/)
from [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/search/fitness) for calculating the health totals as well as creating the exercises.

### Journal 3, 2/5-12/2024
Looked into which HTTP client to use for connecting to APIs. Decided to go with OkHttpClient after reading a stack overflow [post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42392778/okhttp-or-httpclient-which-offers-better-functionality-and-more-efficiency) & [article](https://www.wiremock.io/post/java-http-client-comparison) by WireMock.
While creating my JSP pages I looked at this [site](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/) to help set up my footer CSS.
Overall for this week I created the basic display JSPs and layouts for other files to be easily added as well as all the dependencies to the `pom.xml`.
