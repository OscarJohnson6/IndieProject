## Fitness App Project
*This is an Indie Java project created to log health information and generate exercises.*

### Description
Tracking fitness and health can be difficult. 
With different apps requiring to be paid for or having lots of advertisements, 
some examples are the Fitbit and Apple Fitness app on phones which promote 
and lock content behind their premium version. Another problem with health 
apps is not displaying all the information in one spot, an example is with 
the site calculator.net which can calculate the total one at a time so if 
you wanted to know your daily caloric amount as well as BMI you would have 
to re-input everything each time. My idea for a fitness app is to have an 
area to display all your calculated totals, as well as another section 
allowing you to create a randomized exercise set based on what you selected 
like doing just upper body or arms.
