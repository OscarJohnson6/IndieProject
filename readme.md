<h2>Fitness App Project</h2>
This is an Indie Java project created to log health information and generate exercises. 

<h3>Description</h3>
Tracking fitness and health can be difficult. 
With different apps requiring to be paid for or having lots of advertisements, 
some examples are the Fitbit and Apple Fitness app on phones which promote and 
lock content behind their premium version. 
Another problem with health apps is not displaying all the information in one spot, 
an example is with the site calculator.net which can calculate the total one at a 
time so if you wanted to know your daily caloric amount as well as BMI you would 
have to re-input everything each time. 
My idea for a fitness app is to have an area to display all your calculated totals, 
as well as another section allowing you to create a randomized exercise set based 
on what you selected like doing just upper body or arms.

This is an indie project in Java, using different APIs.
